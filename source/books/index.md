**Unix philosophy**

- **Do one thing and do it well** - Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

- **Everything is file** - Ease of use and security is offered by treating hardware as a file.

- **Small is beautiful**

- **Store data and configuration in flat text files** - Text file is a universal interface. Easy to create, backup and move files to another system.

- **Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability** - Use shell script to automate common tasks across various UNIX / Linux installations.

- **Chain programs together to complete complex task** - Use shell pipes and filters to chain small utilities that perform one task at time.

- **Choose portability over efficiency**.

- **Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS)**.
